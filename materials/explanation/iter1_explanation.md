Iteration 1
===========

Timeline
--------

Iteration 1 is the period **Starting** at the end of [First Meeting](first_meeting.md) and **Ending** at the beginning of Iteration 1 demo time 
during **11/12 - 11/13 (Tuesday - Wednesday)**.


Required Components
-------------------

In Iteration 1, you will be evaluated on the following items:

#### Project Wiki
- Ensure that your team has already set up its project webpage in GitLab similar to the [sample format](sample_page.md).
- Be sure to set up some time for the *Weekly Meetings* for the entire team. 
- Have the *Progress Report* show the plan for the **entire** project. 
  It is acceptable if the details of the future iterations are not fully clear yet, but you shall at least have some plans for them.
- Your project webpage shall be updated frequently (to show continuous progress) and not moments before the meeting. 
  Your course staff supervisor will check this.

#### Git
- Commit frequently to the team repository. The course staff supervisor will check this too.
- Please include meaningful commit log messages, and don't commit automatically generated files (such as class files) into the repository.
- **Tag your code and documents** at the end of Iteration 1 as ``Iteration-1``.

#### User Stories
- Demonstrate collective consideration and knowledge of what shall be done.
- You must have developed user stories that completely describe expected functionality.
- The user stories must be documented on your project webpage 
  (see the [sample format](sample_page.md#progress-report) user story decomposition).
- For more details on user stories and planning game, see [Agile Requirements Elicitation](AgileRE.pdf) and [Chapters 12 and 13 of Extreme Software Engineering](Extreme_Software_Engineering.pdf).

#### Required Code
- You don't need to have much code or tests for Iteration 1, but you shall have some code and tests, 
 as per discussion with the course staff supervisor.
- Some tests (for test-driven development) or prototype would always be nice.

> The most important thing during the meeting is to convince your course staff supervisor that your team is making steady progress towards 
> completing the project, and that you are following the XP process. Be prepared to show actual code/tests that does something useful.

#### Collective Code Ownership
- Ensure that your project has collective code ownership. While the main authors of the code will be more familiar with a certain component,
 we do expect that everyone has (at least) a high level overview of all the different components in the system (even those that they did not 
 work on exclusively).
- The course staff supervisor will attempt to ascertain whether your team exhibits collective code ownership.


Iteration Meeting Procedures
----------------------------

#### General
- Punctuality is important. **A student team member will be penalized for being late to meetings**, or 
 otherwise do not show respect to other team members' or course staff supervisor's time. If you know that you might be late, 
 please let other team members and course staff supervisor know in advance.
- **We expect all team members to attend all the team meetings** except for justified excuses (medical reasons, business travel, etc.)
- Bring up any important issues during the meeting with the course staff supervisor, especially if your team has run into serious problems. 
(If you do run into problems, it's even better to contact the course staff supervisor before the meeting.)
- Bring one presentation laptop that will be used to connect to the projector. Make sure that everything that your team is going to talk about 
  during the meeting is installed on the presentation laptop. Do not switch between laptops during the meeting, because this wastes time.

#### Agenda
- All meetings **must** have a written agenda.
- The agenda must be printed on paper or shown on the projection display (e.g., from the project webpage or a presentation application). 
- Sample agenda:
  - Check user stories accomplished in this iteration
  - Discuss issues on automated tests
  - Discuss major problems/breakthroughs this iteration
  - Reevaluate user stories and estimates
  - Discuss risk items and risk-management actions

#### Meeting Roles
- There are four roles as follows (see [Chapter 21.3 of Code Complete 2](cc2-21-3.pdf) for more details).  The roles of moderator and scribe are particularly important for each meeting.
  * Moderator hosts the meeting.
  * Author wrote the design or code.
  * Reviewer has a direct interest in the design or code but is not the author.
  * Scribe takes notes.
- The team/development leader for Iteration 1 will be _Moderator_.
- The planning leader for Iteration 1 will be _Scribe_
- Scribe will  post minutes of the meeting  on the project webpage, including:
  * important issues that were brought up during the meeting
  * code smells and suggested refactorings during the meeting
  * decisions/suggestions from the course staff supervisor concerning the project
  * any additional actions
- We expect significant contribution from **everyone** in the team. In general, if a student is exceptionally quiet during a meeting, it may indicate that the student has not participated enough in the project. Take action to ensure that the course staff supervisor can verify your contribution.
