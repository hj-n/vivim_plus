Final Code Submission
---------------------

- __Due 12/14 11:59pm__, please tag the final version (code, tests, and documentation) as ``Final``.
- Your tagged code shall exhibit the following:
    1. __Short comments__ have been provided for all public methods and classes 
       following the proper commenting conventions (i.e., Javadoc).
    2. All code has been properly and consistently formatted either manually or by using the code formatter in Eclipse.
    3. All unnecessary dead code (e.g., unused code snippets, unused import statements, etc.) has been removed.
    4. Packages/modules/directories/etc. have been properly used to organize your code. 
    5. Make sure that this final version __actually compiles and runs__. The course staff need to be able 
       to run your project on their computer.
    6. Make sure that __the automated tests and manual tests are passing__.
    
- You must have good automated tests (unit tests) for the majority of your code, and blackbox tests (automated or manual) for all of the user stories.

Final Report
------------

- __Due 12/15 11:59pm__, please submit the report to the course LMS system.
- Each team shall submit a final document in PDF format.

- The report needs to address the following:
  1. Brief description of your projct
     - Explain the goals of the project, and the problem that you are trying to solve.
  2. Architecture and design
     - Explain the major components of your implementation and how they are related.
     - If you want to sketch some UML diagrams of main classes, you can do so.
  3. Appendix
     - How to run the tests for your implemented requirements.
     - In case you are doing some manual testing, the instructions for those shall be detailed enough.
     
> Write the report as if you are writing it for new developers who are about to join your project. 
> Include enough details so that they can get started quickly but do not overwhelm them with too much 
> information that would be easier to find out from reading the code.

- Please submit your final report in a readable format (preferably PDF).


Peer/Self Evaluation
--------------------

- __Due 12/16 11:59pm__, each student __must__ turn in a peer evaluation form.
- Peer evaluations are confidential; your team members will not know what you write about them. Please be honest when you do the evaluations.
- Additionally, you shall write a personal evaluation of your own contributions to the project.
- You shall download the evalutation form from the course LMS system (Homework management), and upload your completed form to LMS as well.
