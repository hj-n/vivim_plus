Iteration 2
===========

Timeline
--------

Iteration 2 is the period **Starting** at the end of the [Iteration 1 meeting](iter1.md) and **Ending** at the beginning of Iteration 2 demo time 
during **11/26 â€“ 11/28 (Tuesday - Thursday)**.

Required Components
-------------------

We will use most guidelines that we had for [Iteration 1](iter1.md). We have also listed the things that your group shall pay more attention to.

#### Project Wiki
 - Ensure that your project wiki is up-to-date, following the [format](sample_page.md) that we suggested.
 - Have the details be concrete enough so your course staff supervisor can see what your team actually did for Iteration 2.
 - Keep your *Progress Report* sections and pages for user stories updated. You will lose points if your project webpage is not up-to-date.
 - __Your team's homepage shall be frequently updated (to show continuous progress), not moments before the meeting, and definitely not during the meeting.__

#### Git
 - Please make sure that you commit the code often into the team repository. 
   Please ensure that 
    * include meaningful commit messages where __your pair's name or Hemos id__ is included when working in pairs.
    * describe what your pair did in the commit message (you can just refer to a task or story on the project homepage, need not copy all the text).
    * do not commit  generated files (such as class files or the .git directory) into the repository.
 - **Tag your code and documents** at the end of Iteration 2 as ``Iteration-2``.

####  User Stories and Planning
 - Ensure that the __user stories are listed and broken down into tasks for all iterations prior to the meeting.__
 - The user stories must be documented on your project wiki 
  (see the [sample format](sample_page.md) user story decomposition).

#### Required Code and Tests
 - Ensure that your project has some __project code__ along with __automated tests__ for the code components. 
   Only project code alone is not enough. You will need automated tests as well. 
 - An easy way to show that you are following XP is to have several commits for each story or task: 
   first commit some new tests that you added (even if failing, although in general it is not good to have failing tests), 
   then commit the code that makes the test pass, then refactor the code and commit the changes. 
   That way you can show you are following the __test-code-refactor cycle__.

#### Collective Code Ownership
 - Ensure that your project has __collective code ownership__. 
   While the main authors of the code will be more familiar with a certain component, we do expect that everyone has (at least) 
  a high level overview of all the different components in the system (even those that they did not work on exclusively). 
 - There shall be no "big pairs" (more than two students) or "pairs helping another pair" (pairs who did nothing else but help other pairs). 
 - All members shall be prepared to answer questions about the system.
 

Iteration Meeting
-----------------

 - Ensure that your team comes to the meeting prepared with an agenda.
 - Bring one presentation laptop that will be used to connect to the projector. 
   Make sure that everything that your team is going to talk about during the meeting is installed on the presentation laptop.
  Make sure that the presentation laptop can build and run the presented code and project.
  Do not switch between laptops during the meeting, because this wastes time.
 - Your team members shall assume the roles of MARS again (see Iteration 1 for more information). 
   However, each member shall pick a different role from that in the Iteration 1 meeting. 
  Please make sure each team member has active participation during the meeting.
 - Ensure that your team takes proper minutes for the meeting so you know what to act on next. 
   The minutes shall be posted on the wiki within 24 hrs of the meeting. Also specify in the minutes the role of each team member 
  during the Iteration 2 meeting.
 - Bring up any important issues regarding the future direction of the project during the meeting with the course staff. 
   Iteration 2 is a good time to discuss the scope of your project (because your team has a better idea on the pace of the planning game) 
  and set the expectations for your final product. 
 - Again, as a reminder, the final project is not just about the final product but also your team's software development process (see the [Grading Policy](grading.md)). 
   So you need to demonstrate that you are following XP closely as your software development process and that you are making steady 
  progress toward completing your final project.


Checklist
---------
 - Do you have a meeting agenda?
 - Have you decided on your roles? Make sure each student has a different role from the last iteration
 - Have you frequently updated the project web page in GitLab?
 - Have you frequently submitted code to the Git repository? 
 - Did you tag your work as ``Iteration-2`` before the meeting?
 - Have you notified us of important technical issues in advance?
 - Can your code be run on all your team members' computers, especially on the presenter's computer?
 - Can your tests be run on all your team members' computers, especially on the presenter's computer?
 - Has each pair made several commits in the Git repository?
 - Has each pair written (or updated) several automated tests?
 - Does your commit message include your pair's name or Hemos id? Did you say what your pair did in the commit message?  
 - Also, you shall not have any blank commit messages.
 - Has your plan been updated with better estimates?
 - Are the meeting minutes posted on the homepage within 24 hours? Your minutes shall have __enough details__ to recall what 
   was discussed in the meeting. 

> For example, ``discussed user stories`` is not detailed enough, because we do not know what was actually discuseed about user stories.
> Instead, ``the course staff supervisor suggested that user story 1 shall be broken down more`` is better.

 -  Are you prepared to answer questions about each commit log?
 - Did you make enough progress towards the completion of the final project?
