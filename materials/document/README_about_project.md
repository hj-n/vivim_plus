Introduction
============

Projects will be done in project teams of 8~9 students. Each team has a course staff member, i.e., course staff supervisor, that will be working with the team for the rest of the semester. There are seven teams in total.


Your team will work on one of the projects listed on the [Project ideas](project_ideas.md) page to develop an IntelliJ IDEA plug-in that can help software development. Your team needs to have one top project chosen by the First Meeting.


Team projects will be evaluated based on: (1) how well the final product is developed, and (2) how well the team has followed XP. See the [Grading Policy](grading_policy.md) for more details.

Timeline
========

In the rest of the course project, each team will present their progress to the course staff supervisor for the team or the class based on the schedule below:

| Item | Date | Audience |
| ---  | ---  | --- |
| [First Meeting](first_meeting.md) | 11/4 - 11/5 | Course staff |
| [Iteration 1 demo](iter1.md) | 11/12 - 11/13 | Course staff |
| [Class Presentation](presentation1.md)  | 11/14 | Class |
| [Iteration 2 demo](iter2.md) | 11/26 - 11/28 | Course staff |
| [Iteration 3 demo](iter3.md) | 12/12 - 12/13 | Course staff | 
| [Final presentation](presentation2.md) | 12/12 | Class |
| [Final code, report, and peer evaluation](report.md) | 12/14, 15, 16  | Course staff |


Roles and Meetings
==================

Your team shall do role assignments among team members for each of the three iterations (Iterations 1, 2, and 3). 
Your team shall assign three team members to take the following roles:

- _Team/development leader_: motivating team members, moderating team meetings, leading design processes, resolving team-related issues
- _Planning leader_: guiding the team in producing a detailed plan, tracking progress, posting weekly/iteration meeting logs on the project wiki
- _Quality assurance leader_: tracking unit tests and acceptance tests, checking test coverage, performing code review, raising issues about quality (e.g., refactoring)

Note that the role assignment shall reflect the rotation of taking roles, i.e., satisfying the following requirements: 

1. Every team member needs to take __one role__ (some role in one iteration, and some role in another iteration) during the entire semester; 
2. No team member is allowed to take the same role consecutively. Please refer to the lecture on `Team Projects` for more details on role responsibilities.

Including the presenters, there are nine roles as follows (only team/development leader for Iteration 1). This means that every student will take at least one role for this semester. 

| Responsibilities         | Occasions |
| ------------------------ | ----------|
| Team/development leader  | Iteration 1, Iteration 2, Iteration 3 |
| Planning leader          | Iteration 2, Iteration 3 |
| Quality assurance leader | Iteration 2, Iteration 3 |
| Presenters               | first presentation, final presentation |

__Use issue tracking in GitLab or weekly meeting logs to record the activities of the leaders.__
For example, a quality assurance leader may raise issues about the test coverage of a certain class. 

Meetings
========

Ideally, your entire team would meet at least __one evening each week__ to work on the project. Your team may choose any meeting style that works best for you, and which reflects XP practices. 

Please keep minutes of __all__ meetings that you have as a team on your team's GitLab wiki page. Create a child page for the minutes of each meeting. __*All team members must be present at each meeting with the entire team and/or the course staff supervisor.*__


FAQ
===

- Will we be able to change teams? 

> No.

- What if I don't like my team?

> In practice, you will not always choose your teams. Learning how to function effectively within a team is an important skill 
> that you will need. We hope that you can learn some of that in this class.

- Is it fair to force us into teams?

> All teams were formed in more or less the same random manner, similar to what you may experience in the real world when you graduate.
