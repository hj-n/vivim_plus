### Overview

Our project is to implement a convenient, modernized vim plugin for the IntelliJ idea. Even though there already exists a Vim plugin in IDEA, it has some drawbacks. Notably, the plugin does not fit well with the basic facilities provided by IDEA. Therefore, we decided to implement the Vim plugin, which can improve productivity and can be well integrated with the functionalities of IDEA. 

We especially motivated from the Google Chrome plugin `vimium`, which provides vim shortcuts while exploring window. However, the plugin has more simple, but more powerful and convenient shortcuts, comparing to the original vim shortcuts. One of our goal, "convenient" is especially influenced by this factor.
